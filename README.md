01. Prime Number Checker

Description:
This program checks whether a number is prime using square root optimization.

Notes:

Written while learning Python basics.

Efficiently checks for prime numbers by iterating only up to the square root of the number.

02. Factorial Calculator

Description:
This program calculates the factorial of a given number.

Notes:

Written while learning Python basics.

Includes input validation for negative numbers and non-integer input.

Allows the user to calculate factorials of multiple numbers interactively.

03. Asterisk Pyramid Pattern

Description:
This program displays a pyramid pattern of asterisks (*) based on the number of rows entered by the user.

Notes:

Written while learning Python basics.

Uses loops and string multiplication to create the pattern.

Aligns the pyramid in the center using space

04. Hollow Square Pattern

Description:
This program prints a hollow square pattern of asterisks (*) for a given size n. The first and last rows are filled with stars, and the first and last columns of the middle rows have stars while the rest are spaces.

Notes:

Written while learning Python basics.

Works for any integer n ≥ 1.

Uses nested loops to determine whether to print a star or a space.

05. Multiplication Table

Description:
This program prints the multiplication table of a number entered by the user. The table displays values from 1 to 10.

Notes:

Written while learning Python basics.

Uses a function to print the table.

Handles invalid input (non-integer and negative numbers).

Allows the user to repeatedly print tables until they choose to exit.

06. Rock-Paper-Scissors Game

Description:
This program allows the user to play the classic Rock-Paper-Scissors game against the computer. The user can choose between rock, paper, or scissors, and the computer randomly selects its choice. The program then determines the winner based on the standard rules of the game.

Notes:

Written while learning Python basics.

Uses dictionaries to map between user input and numeric values for game logic.

Validates user input to handle typos or incorrect entries.

Includes logic to determine wins, losses, and draws using simple arithmetic.

Allows the user to play multiple rounds until they choose to exit.

07. Multiplication Tables Generator

Description:
This program generates multiplication tables from 2 to 20. Each table is stored in a separate text file inside a folder named Table. The program ensures the folder exists before writing the files, making it easy for anyone to run the script without manual folder creation.

Notes:

Written while learning Python basics.

Uses os.makedirs() to ensure the output folder exists.

Writes each multiplication table (1–10) into separate text files for clarity.

Adds proper line breaks for readability.

Easy to extend to more tables or larger ranges if needed.
